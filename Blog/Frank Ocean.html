      <p>
		I am a lover of music and the healing it brings. I am more particularly a big fan of R&B music and all its
		different variations as it is a very versatile genre of music. Below I'll share details about my favourite artists and a
		little treat for those curious about my fave artist's sound.

		Frank Ocean (born Christopher Edwin Cooksey on October 28, 1987; later Christopher Edwin Breaux) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer,
		and photographer. Ocean began his musical career as a ghostwriter, prior to joining hip hop collective Odd Future in 2010, and the following year released Nostalgia, Ultra,
		his debut mixtape. The mixtape was a critical success and generated the single "Novacane", which peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum.
		Ocean subsequently secured a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings in 2012.
	</p>

		Ocean released his debut studio album, Channel Orange, in July 2012; it debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum.
		The album received universal acclaim from critics and won Ocean his first Grammy Award, for Best Urban Contemporary Album. The album contained the singles "Thinkin Bout You", "Pyramids" and "Sweet Life", with the former peaking inside the top 40 in the US and gaining him a nomination for Record of the Year at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards.
		Ocean's music has been characterized by music writers as idiosyncratic in style. Ocean's music generally includes the electronic keyboard,
		often performed by Ocean himself, and is backed by a subdued rhythm section in the production. His compositions are often midtempo,
		feature unconventional melodies, and they occasionally have an experimental song structure. He has been characterised as both an "avant-garde R&B artist" and a "pop musician".
